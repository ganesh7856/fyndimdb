Scalability refers to the ability of a system to give a reasonable performance under growing demands (This can be larger data-sets, higher request rates, the combination of size and velocity, etc). It should work well with 1 user or 5 million users and handles spikes in traffic automatically. By adding and removing the resources only when needed, scalable apps consume only the resources necessary to meet demand.

Horizontal scaling (Scaling Out)
Scaling out or horizontal scaling refers to resource increment by the addition of units to the app’s cloud architecture. This means adding more units of smaller capacity instead of adding a single unit of larger capacity. The requests for resources are then spread across multiple units thus reducing the excess load on a single machine.

The followings are point to be implemented 

Ease server load :
      We need to quickly handle spikes in traffic, generated by activity on the blog post, so let’s reduce server load by moving image and video to some third -party content delivery network (CDN). AWS provides Amazon CloudFront as a CDN solution
	  
Reduce read load by adding more read replicas:
       MySQL provides a nice mirror replication for databases. Oracle has its own Oracle plug for replication and AWS RDS provide up to five read replicas	 
	 
Reduce write requests :
       This can be achieved by introducing queue to process the asynchronous message. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a highly-scalable queue, which can handle any kind of work-message load. 
	
Introduce a more robust caching engine:
       You can use Amazon Elastic Cache for Memcached or Redis to reduce write requests. Memcached and Redis have different use cases so if you can afford to lose and recover your cache from your database, use Memcached
     
Scale your server:
		 If there are still issues, it’s time to scale your server.  For the greatest cost-effectiveness and unlimited scalability, I suggest always using horizontal scaling.AWS provides Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
